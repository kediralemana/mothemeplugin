Theme Images Directory
======================

This directory should contain the following images:

1. screenshot.jpg or screenshot.png
   - A screenshot of your theme (recommended size: 1200x700 pixels)
   - This will be displayed in the theme selector
   - Should showcase the main features of your theme

2. favicon.ico (optional)
   - A favicon for your site
   - Recommended size: 16x16 or 32x32 pixels

These images are optional but recommended for a professional appearance.

To add these images:
1. Create or capture a screenshot of your theme
2. Save it as screenshot.jpg or screenshot.png in this directory
3. Optionally, add a favicon.ico file

Note: These files are not included in the repository by default.
You should add your own images that represent your theme.
